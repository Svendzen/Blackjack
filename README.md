# Blackjack

## Description

This project was created as a practice exercise when I began learning C#. It is a terminal-based application that runs entirely in the console. The program features a menu-driven interface and a limited text-based GUI, allowing users to interact through simple text commands. This project helped me understand fundamental C# programming concepts, including control flow, data handling, and user input/output operations.

## Features

- Menu-driven navigation
- Text-based graphical elements
- Terminal-only execution
